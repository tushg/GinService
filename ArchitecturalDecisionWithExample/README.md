# Architectural Decision Documentation

This folder contains comprehensive documentation for key architectural decisions in the Gin service project, along with practical examples and implementation guides.

## Contents

### 1. Repository Architecture Decision
**File:** `01_repository_architecture_decision.md`

- **Repository per Module vs Centralized Repository Layer**
- Analysis of both approaches
- Recommendation for Gin service
- Implementation examples
- When to use each approach

### 2. Transactions with Separate Repositories
**File:** `02_transactions_with_separate_repositories.md`

- **How to handle transactions with separate repositories**
- Transaction manager implementation
- Repository composition patterns
- Service layer orchestration
- Cross-module queries
- Complete examples with code

## Key Decisions Made

### ✅ Repository Architecture: Per-Module
- **Decision**: Use separate repositories for each module (health, product, etc.)
- **Reasoning**: Better encapsulation, easier testing, Go-idiomatic, microservices-ready
- **Implementation**: Each module owns its data access logic

### ✅ Transaction Handling: Transaction Manager
- **Decision**: Implement shared transaction manager for cross-repository operations
- **Reasoning**: Maintains separation while enabling complex operations
- **Implementation**: Service layer orchestrates transactions across repositories

## Benefits of Our Architecture

1. **Clean Separation**: Each module is self-contained
2. **Transaction Support**: Full ACID compliance with automatic rollbacks
3. **Complex Operations**: Can handle multi-table operations and joins
4. **Easy Testing**: Mock repositories are co-located with modules
5. **Future Flexibility**: Easy to extract modules or refactor
6. **Go Best Practices**: Follows Go's package organization principles

## Implementation Patterns

- **Repository per Module**: Each module owns its data access
- **Transaction Manager**: Shared utility for cross-repository transactions
- **Service Orchestration**: Business logic coordinates multiple repositories
- **Query Services**: Dedicated services for complex cross-module queries

## When to Use This Architecture

- ✅ **Small to medium Go services**
- ✅ **Team of 1-5 developers**
- ✅ **Simple to moderate database complexity**
- ✅ **Future microservices consideration**
- ✅ **Go-idiomatic codebase**

## When to Consider Alternatives

- ❌ **Very complex enterprise applications**
- ❌ **Heavy database operations with dedicated DB teams**
- ❌ **Frequent database switching requirements**
- ❌ **Complex query optimization needs**

## Conclusion

Our chosen architecture provides the **best of both worlds**: clean separation of concerns with full transaction support. It's the Go way, it's maintainable, and it scales well for most use cases.
