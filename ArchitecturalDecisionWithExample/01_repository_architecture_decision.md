# Repository Architecture Decision: Per-Module vs Centralized

## Overview

This document outlines the architectural decision between two approaches for organizing database repositories in a Go Gin service:
1. **Repository per Module** (Recommended)
2. **Centralized Repository Layer** (Java-style)

## Repository per Module (Recommended) âœ…

### Structure
```
internal/
â”œâ”€â”€ health/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repository.go      # Health-specific repository
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service.go
â””â”€â”€ product/
    â”œâ”€â”€ repository.go      # Product-specific repository
    â””â”€â”€ service.go
```

### Advantages

1. **Better Encapsulation**
   - Each module owns its data access logic
   - Clear boundaries between modules
   - Easier to understand what data each module needs

2. **Easier Testing**
   - Mock repositories are co-located with the module
   - Unit tests are more focused and isolated
   - Better test coverage per module

3. **Microservices Ready**
   - If you ever split into microservices, each module is self-contained
   - Easier to extract individual modules
   - Better separation of concerns

4. **Go Idioms**
   - Go encourages package-based organization
   - Each package should be self-sufficient
   - Follows Go's "package as unit of reuse" principle

5. **Easier Maintenance**
   - Changes to health data access don't affect product module
   - Developers working on one module don't need to understand others
   - Clear ownership and responsibility

### When Centralized Repository Makes Sense

1. **Complex Database Operations**
   - If you have complex joins across multiple entities
   - Shared database transactions
   - Complex query optimization

2. **Database-Specific Logic**
   - If you're switching between different databases
   - Database migration management
   - Connection pooling strategies

3. **Team Structure**
   - If you have dedicated database engineers
   - Database operations are centralized in your organization

## Centralized Repository Layer (Java-style)

### Structure
```
internal/
â”œâ”€â”€ health/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service.go
â”œâ”€â”€ product/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service.go
â””â”€â”€ repository/           # Centralized data access layer
    â”œâ”€â”€ health.go
    â”œâ”€â”€ product.go
    â””â”€â”€ interfaces.go
```

## Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

### Structure
```
internal/
â”œâ”€â”€ health/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repository.go      # Health-specific repository
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service.go
â”œâ”€â”€ product/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repository.go      # Product-specific repository
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service.go
â””â”€â”€ repository/            # Shared database utilities
    â”œâ”€â”€ base.go           # Common repository interface
    â”œâ”€â”€ transaction.go    # Transaction management
    â””â”€â”€ connection.go     # Connection utilities
```

## Implementation Example

### Repository per Module
```go
// internal/health/repository.go
type HealthRepository interface {
    GetHealth(ctx context.Context) (*Health, error)
    UpdateHealth(ctx context.Context, health *Health) error
}

type healthRepository struct {
    db     *sql.DB
    logger logger.Logger
}

// internal/product/repository.go
type ProductRepository interface {
    GetProduct(ctx context.Context, id string) (*Product, error)
    CreateProduct(ctx context.Context, product *Product) error
}

type productRepository struct {
    db     *sql.DB
    logger logger.Logger
}
```

## Recommendation for Gin Service

**Stick with Repository per Module** for your Gin service because:

1. **Simplicity**: Your health and product modules are likely simple CRUD operations
2. **Maintainability**: Easier for a single developer or small team to maintain
3. **Go Best Practices**: Follows Go's package organization principles
4. **Future Flexibility**: Easy to refactor or extract modules later

## Conclusion

**Repository per Module** is the Go way, it's simpler to maintain, and it gives you better separation of concerns. The centralized approach is more suitable for complex enterprise applications with heavy database operations and dedicated database teams.

Your current structure is actually following modern Go best practices! ðŸš€
